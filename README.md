Perch CMS plugin/widget which displays Dashboard Widget of Members and their Created Date

This plugin was created for another user of Perch CMS. Basically it shows a dashboard (must have dashboard enabled in settings) of Members and their signup date. If you click on a members name you will be routed to the members app where you can edit the member. This widget MAKES NO CHANGES to your data, it just presents it to you iin a new way.

If you use this plugin, please give me a shout and let me know if your having any problems.

Thanks so much.
