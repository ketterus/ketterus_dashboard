Basically it shows a dashboard (must have dashboard enabled in settings) of Members and their signup date. If you click on a members name you will be routed to the members app where you can edit the member. This widget MAKES NO CHANGES to your data, it just presents it to you iin a new way.\r\n\r\nIf you use this plugin, please give me a shout and let me know if your having any problems.\r\n\r\nThanks so much.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
